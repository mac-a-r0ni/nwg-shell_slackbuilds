# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-dasbus: python-dasbus (python3 DBus library based on glib)
python-dasbus:
python-dasbus: Dasbus is a DBus library written in Python 3, based on GLib and
python-dasbus: inspired by pydbus. The code used to be part of the Anaconda
python-dasbus: Installer project. It was based on the pydbus library, but we
python-dasbus: replaced it with our own solution because its upstream development
python-dasbus: stalled. The dasbus library is a result of this effort.
